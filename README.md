Description of Cine Plus Americanistas

The Cine Plus project is an application developed in wxGlade that aims to manage the main functions
of a cinema in a simple and organized way. The system consists of four windows that represent the 
essential stages of the process: a login window for system access, a box office window for selecting 
movies and selling tickets, a concession stand window where the products chosen by the customer 
are recorded, and finally, a payment window where all the information is gathered to complete the transaction. 
This project seeks to offer a clear and functional interface that facilitates the workflow within 
the cinema and allows for efficient customer service.

SCREEN 1 
Window 1 of the Cine Plus project corresponds to the login screen, which serves as the main access
to the system and as the first security filter for the staff using it. This window is designed 
for employees to enter their credentials, usually a username and a password, in order to verify their
identity before allowing the use of the program's other functions. Its purpose is to ensure that only
authorized individuals can manage the cinema's operations, preventing unauthorized access and
maintaining proper control of the system.

Visually, this window features a simple and clear interface, focused on facilitating the login process
from the user's first contact with the application. Once the provided data is validated, the system
allows proceeding to the next windows of the project, such as ticketing, concession stand, or payment.
In this way, the login window establishes the starting point of the entire workflow within Cine Plus
and ensures that the use of the application remains organized and controlled from the beginning.

SCREEN 2
Window 2 of the Cine Plus project corresponds to the ticket booth module, where the selection of the movie 
and the sale of tickets to the customer take place. This window is designed so that the employee can quickly
and efficiently choose from the available options, such as the movie title, the showtime, and the number
of tickets the customer wants to purchase. Its purpose is to streamline the service process and ensure that
the information is correctly recorded within the system.

The interface of this window presents the necessary elements to make the selection process clear and efficient,
providing a simple user experience for the staff. Once the movie and the number of tickets are determined,
the system prepares this data so that it can be integrated with the subsequent stages of the workflow,
such as the sale of products at the concession stand and the final calculation of the charge. Overall,
this window constitutes a fundamental part of the overall operation of Cine Plus, as it represents the first
point of direct interaction with the customer regarding their experience within the cinema.

SCREEN 3
Window 3 of the Cine Plus project corresponds to the concession area, where the products the customer wants
to consume during the show are recorded. In this section, the employee can choose from different combos,
snacks, and drinks available, allowing each product to be easily added to the order. 
Its purpose is to complement the ticket purchase with consumable items, integrating everything 
within the same system.

The interface of this window is organized to make product selection easier, displaying the options clearly and accessibly.
Each selection made is automatically added to the purchase record, preparing the information for the final stage of the process.
Thanks to this window, the system can keep an accurate record of the products sold at the concession stand, 
which contributes to faster and more organized service. Overall, this module allows completing the customer experience
in the cinema by adding the food and drinks that will accompany their visit.

SCREEN 4
Window 4 of the Cine Plus project corresponds to the payment module, where all the information generated
in the previous stages is gathered to complete the transaction. This window shows the total amount to be paid,
which includes both the tickets selected at the box office and the products added at the concession stand.
Its purpose is to allow the employee to verify the details, confirm the final amount, and record the payment made by the customer.

The interface of this window is designed to present the cost breakdown clearly and orderly, facilitating the review
process before completing the purchase. Once the charge is confirmed, the system concludes the operation and prepares
the program to serve the next customer. This window represents the closure of the workflow within the Cine Plus project,
ensuring that all sales are properly recorded and that service is carried out efficiently and in a controlled manner.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
In the development of the Cine Plus project, the following technologies were mainly used:

wxGlade: a tool used for designing the graphical interface. It allows creating windows and visual
components visually and generating the corresponding code in wxPython.

wxPython: a Python library used to build the graphical interface based on the elements designed in wxGlade.
It provides the controls, windows, and events needed for the system to function.

Python: the project's core programming language, responsible for the system's logic, data management,
validations, and communication between the different windows.
